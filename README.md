# Torres
Hello Everyone!!

My name is Michael Torres. There is usually more than one Michael, so feel free to call me Michael,Mike,or by my last name,Torres. I'm honestly more used to being called Torres.

I completed a FullStack Web Development Course a few years back. Unfortunately, finding a job at the time was very hard and I had received an opportunity to be an Executive Chef for a 4 star resort. So I ended up taking the job and here I am. Being a Chef is very time consuming, especially when you have two toddlers. I feel it's time to get back into the Programming world.

Favorite hobbies revolve around music. I've been playing guitar since I was 12 years old. I also have dabbled in playing drums, keyboard, as well as bass.

I'm looking forward to learning as much as I can and moving forward with a new career.
